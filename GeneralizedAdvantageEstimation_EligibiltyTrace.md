> * Bias means the estimates systematically differ from the true expected return. 
This happens when you use bootstrapping (i.e., estimating value using other learned estimates) 
like in actor-critic methods or TD learning
> * Variance is caused by Monte-Carlo updates, there are many paths from one point to another, which may result in different returns which may very a lot

> * We will introduce a parameter Î³ that allows us to reduce variance by downweighting rewards corresponding to delayed effects, at the cost of introducing bias. This parameter corresponds to the
discount factor used in discounted formulations of MDPs, but we treat it as a variance reduction
parameter in an undiscounted problem
